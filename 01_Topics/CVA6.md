CVA6 (formerly Ariane) [3] is a popular 64-bit RISC-V core with a six-stage pipeline, and support for RV64GC. Its microarchitectural structure includes a physically-indexed, physically-tagged configurable L1 instruction cache, a write-back L1 data cache, and configurable branch prediction logic based on bimodal static prediction schemes. Featuring an MMU with Sv39 paging, and AXI4 interconnect, CVA6 balances efficiency and scalability, making it a go-to choice for both academia and industry
