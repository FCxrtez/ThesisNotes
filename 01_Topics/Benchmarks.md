The RISC-V Microbenchmark suite from UC Davis [52] provides targeted tests for ISA and microarchitecture validation,such as control flow, dependencies, execution, and memory operations. While Michiganâ€™s MiBench [45] offers real-world applications across automotive, networking, and security domains.
